ImageHue is a simple tool to use any image as source of color for your hue lights.

## Features
- Load any image as source of color for groups of lights
- The color is chosen randomly from the image
- Adjust the time between the colors and the transition speed
- Randomize times
- Sync the transition time with the time between colors, so it looks like an infinite transition
- No installation required, just run the app
